            <p class="nav__body">On November 6th, I born in a German hospital to an American couple: a rugby-playing airborne ranger and a body-builder psychologist. She was on bike tour in Europe. He was stationed overseas. One side of the story is that they met rock climbing. (Athleticism has been in my genes from my beginnings, but I’m only now learning about ambition.)</p>

            <h3 class="nav__title">Mtn View, California: My first running memory</h3>
            <p class="nav__body">My first memory of running is this: I was in the first grade and ran a step behind my dad and older sister. We looped around the army base we lived on in northern California and I was in jeans and jellies. We (or as I later found out, they) were training for a family fun-run at the San Jose Zoo. The night before the race, I prepared by laying out my pink sweatsuit on the ground as if I were in it. That morning, they didn’t wake me. I walked next to my mom strollering my brothers the whole god damn 5k. </p>

            <p class="nav__body">My mom is a runner. When we moved to England, she started and grew the Women’s Running Network by passing out business cards to other women she saw out on her runs. As a ten year old, I ran alongside women who were running for the first time and for the fun of it. We would start and end weekly runs at The Apple Tree and The Jolly Farmer, two pubs down the street. The group still exists today.</p>

            <h3 class="nav__title">Monument, Colorado: An introduction to soccer</h3>
            <p class="nav__body">My family moved to Colorado, and I started playing soccer with all of the shocking seriousness Coloradan middle school soccer had to offer. (Soccer is important here because my relationship to running has been greatly impacted by soccer injuries.) What I remember is this: the high-altitude air, the dry heat, and being so afraid that both were making me look like a Hansen brother (At this age I refused put my hair up because of my ears) when I was trying to make and keep friends. This is also where I met Kaylan. I was known for being quick, but Kaylan was known for having the “run-alot-gene”. I always wished I had those genes, too.

            <h3 class="nav__title">Monument, Colorado: Soccer ACL I</h3>
            <p class="nav__body">Freshman year high school soccer tryouts: the big leagues. This week, I tore my ACL. What I remember is this: not a whole lot. I blacked out. And then I remember my dad scratching my back that evening as I honest-to-God cried into a bowl of Sponge Bob macroni & cheese because, “Why me, God?”  After several months of flexion and extension exercises, I started enjoying my bike-rehab so much that I got certified to teach spin classes at our small local gym. (I definitely had to get my mom’s signature since I was 17). </p>

            <p class="nav__body">My aunt (who is also a personal-trainer) gifted me with the works at CU Sports Medicine and Performance Center: alongside a slew of sports-performance tests, I also received consultations with a nutritionist, whom I called Carbo Carrie because she made me eat so many god damn carbohydrates. At the time, though I didn’t know it,  I was struggling with disordered eating, and I secretly hated Carbo Carrie for the absurd amount of kcals she required me to eat, but I also secretly loved my aunt for intervening. </p>

            <p class="nav__body">I ran my first half marathon with my mom the summer between high school and college. (It was called the slackers half marathon. It was all downhill, and it was perfect.) My soccer conditioning got me further than I thought I could go, and I remember feeling proud of myself, maybe for the first time ever.</p>

            <p class="nav__body">I started college at a small liberal arts college, and living in a dorm taught me that I’m an introvert. I added more weekly mileage as an excuse to get alone time and also to subdue hard feelings from divorcing parents. I raced another half marathon (again, with my mom) and got 3rd in my age group, which put a pep in my step. I felt those proud feelings again, so I started running even more after that.</p>

            <p class="nav__body">During my sophomore year, I joined my NCAA college’s cross country team as a walk on. I loved the structure in an otherwise chaotic time in my life. I ran, but not great. To me, being on the team meant connecting to lightheartedness and wise friends, like Lisa and Brian, who guided me through hard seasons. I also wanted to be around my coach’s patience, resilience, kindness, and life lessons on running as much as possible.

            <h3 class="nav__title">Santa Barbara, California: That time I gave up running for the foreseeable future
</h3>
            <p class="nav__body">At this point, my relationship with running was complicated: it made me proud and it made me calm, but it was also tangled up with my anxiety. When triggers would flare complicated feelings, I would beat myself up by pounding out miles as a distraction. After doing some version of this for the better part of a decade, I had a clear, scary moment of honesty one day. (I say “scary” because running had become a coping mechanism on purpose and I was deeply afraid of facing some hard feelings.) The best way I can describe it here is that the sky parted and I was able to to view my behaviour without judgement: <br>

I didn’t like myself and I couldn’t understand why anyone would. I thought that somehow I could reach my potential and become a better version of myself if I could just put more on my plate and then make a rigid game-plan to ensure that I excelled at all of it-- the miles, the peace- keeping, the calories in/calories out ratio, the goal-setting, and the daily task of keeping all the hard and important emotions down.
<br>
I was exhausted, to say the least, but I had hope that if others were allowed to trust themselves with emotions and eating and running and relationships then maybe I could learn to do that, too. I decided to stop running for the foreseeable future. I was going to feel all the feelings and get help with my relationship with food, fitness, my family, and myself.

          <p class="nav__body">The task of feeling all the feelings entailed learning to trust myself, my body, and my emotions. Overtime, without consciously being totally aware of the shift, I started moving and eating and connecting to others for the love of it and for the love of myself.</p>

          <h3 class="nav__title">Santa Barbara, California: My birthday marathon</h3>
          <p class="nav__body">During my senior year of college, I decided to run a marathon on my 22nd birthday with one of my oldest and best friends, Kelly (who is also a runner and also a riot). Through her own story, Kelly is the person in my life who initially sparked the hope in my head that I could dance alone in my bedroom, or jog to a smoothie shop--or do anything for that matter-- for the sheer enjoyment of it.  (She is also probably at the top of the everyone’s life for “People I want to run 4 hours with.”) I laughed, I cried, and I got my exact goal time of 3:45 while feeling deeply connected to myself. </p>
